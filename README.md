# TEAM PICK ME
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkgovC1pjnU
#### Description: Helps you pick teams with an online web tool. It is hosted on Heroku, and it uses HTML5 and Bootstrap 4. It's very lightweight and simple to use, and it even helps you to save the session so that you can use the same settings on another day.
Try the website for yourself! Just click on the link below:

## Design choices
##### I thought about adding a login system to store inputs by users but found that it was ultimately unnecessary.
Firstly, I felt that the user should be able to use the tool as soon as possible, as wasting their time would just mean they would not use it and be put off by the requirement of registration.
Secondly, acknowledging that sessions can be considered an insecure way to hold data, I believe that it was okay, since the data that the use should be inputting is non-sensitive, so it should not pose as a risk.

##### Why flask?
 Flask is very lightweight and minimalist compared to other tools such as Django, so it is easier to develop with it. Also, I did not believe that a simple app like this would require a full stack development software like Django. I fell in love with cs50's finance theme as well, as it gives a very casual and minimalist vibe.
 
##### Adding more visuals?
I feel like a minimalist design would be better for the website as the people using it should just open it up, select the teams and get to playing. I thought about adding animations when the scrambling. However, adding more visual clutter forgoing clarity would take away from my vision for this app.

##### More features?
Potentially, an option for more teams could be added, however most competitive games would only pit two teams against each other. Another promising option would be to make the same result be seen by members on the same link, so that the validity would not be compromised by the host in an online environment. However, using streaming tools such as the one conveniently available on discord would be a good workaround if it arises as an issue.

## Usage

####

 - Hover over the black circle icon
 - Enter in number of participants
 - Change default names of members (Optional)
 - Scramble!

> You are able to scramble the teams again once you have scrambled so that it's more convenient when you want to reshuffle after the game!
